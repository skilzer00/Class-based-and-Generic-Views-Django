# Class-based-and-Generic-Views-Django
In this lab, you have learned how to implement the app features such as returning a list of courses and course details using class-based and generic views. You may compare the commented-out function-based views with the built-in generic views and understand how class-based views help reduce the workload by abstracting the common tasks in super classes.
